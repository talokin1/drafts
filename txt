Acquiring
Business context

Several working sessions were conducted with Andriy Kredensel (Acquiring business owner) to align the search logic with real acquiring flows and accounting practice.

Change in client search strategy

We shifted from a text-only approach to a transaction-structure–driven approach, focusing on core acquiring settlements:

2924 → 2600

2924 → 2650

2924 → 2655

This allowed us to isolate transactions that are natively linked to acquiring operations.

Additional signals

Acquiring indicators are now identified not only in payment purpose, but also in:

counterparty accounts

counterparty names (e.g. “Internet acquiring”)

Result

November analysis:

1,069 potential acquiring clients (new methodology)

294 clients (previous approach)

→ ~3.6× increase driven by more accurate business logic.

Next steps

Extend the analysis from a single month to full-year transaction history

Validate client stability and recurring acquiring behavior
