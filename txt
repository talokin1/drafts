Project Objective

Forecast expected monthly profit of a corporate client by income streams
before client acquisition, based on financial statements and internal benchmarks.

Why it matters

Smarter RM prioritization
Focus on clients with clear revenue drivers, not just “big companies”

Higher expected revenue per acquired client
Target products with the highest monetization potential

Transparent economics
Understand where exactly the profit will come from (assets / liabilities / fees)

How it works
